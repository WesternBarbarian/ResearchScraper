  "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have been positioned to revolutionize HCI, by\nreshaping not only the interfaces, design patterns, and sociotechnical systems\nthat we study, but also the research practices we use. To-date, however, there\nhas been little understanding of LLMs' uptake in HCI. We address this gap via a\nsystematic literature review of 153 CHI papers from 2020-24 that engage with\nLLMs. We taxonomize: (1) domains where LLMs are applied; (2) roles of LLMs in\nHCI projects; (3) contribution types; and (4) acknowledged limitations and\nrisks. We find LLM work in 10 diverse domains, primarily via empirical and\nartifact contributions. Authors use LLMs in five distinct roles, including as\nresearch tools or simulated users. Still, authors often raise validity and\nreproducibility concerns, and overwhelmingly study closed models. We outline\nopportunities to improve HCI research with and on LLMs, and provide guiding\nquestions for researchers to consider the validity and appropriateness of\nLLM-related work.",
