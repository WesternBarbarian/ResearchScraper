  "summary": "Novel capacities of generative AI to analyze and generate cultural artifacts\nraise inevitable questions about the nature and value of artistic education and\nhuman expertise. Has AI already leveled the playing field between professional\nartists and laypeople, or do trained artistic expressive capacity, curation\nskills and experience instead enhance the ability to use these new tools? In\nthis pre-registered study, we conduct experimental comparisons between 50\nactive artists and a demographically matched sample of laypeople. We designed\ntwo tasks to approximate artistic practice for testing their capabilities in\nboth faithful and creative image creation: replicating a reference image, and\nmoving as far away as possible from it. We developed a bespoke platform where\nparticipants used a modern text-to-image model to complete both tasks. We also\ncollected and compared participants' sentiments towards AI. On average, artists\nproduced more faithful and creative outputs than their lay counterparts,\nalthough only by a small margin. While AI may ease content creation,\nprofessional expertise is still valuable - even within the confined space of\ngenerative AI itself. Finally, we also explored how well an exemplary\nvision-capable large language model (GPT-4o) would complete the same tasks, if\ngiven the role of an image generation agent, and found it performed on par in\ncopying but outperformed even artists in the creative task. The very best\nresults were still produced by humans in both tasks. These outcomes highlight\nthe importance of integrating artistic skills with AI training to prepare\nartists and other visual professionals for a technologically evolving\nlandscape. We see a potential in collaborative synergy with generative AI,\nwhich could reshape creative industries and education in the arts.",
